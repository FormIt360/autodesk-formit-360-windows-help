### Paint with Materials
As we saw in an **[earlier exercise](/Building-the-Farnsworth-House/Work-with-Images-and-the-Ground-Plane.md)**, you can create your own materials, and then paint those materials to faces in FormIt. In this exercise you will create and edit your own materials and import materials from the Autodesk Material library

#### Create the Glass Walls
1. Use the [**Rectangle-Tool-(R)**](../tool-library/rectangle-tool.md) to create another surface on top of the existing floor group

2. Click to start the rectangle sketch at the back corner of the existing floor. Draw the rectangle at these dimensions: **28'-8" x 55'-5 Â½"**
     
3. Click **Esc** to exit the rectangle tool. **Single click** inside the new rectangle to select the face

3. **Double click** and **Group (G)** the new geometry

5. **Double click** the group to edit it. In the **Properties Palette** name the group **Glass Walls**

4. Right click on the top face and choose the [**Offset-Face-tool-(OF)**](../tool-library/extrude-cut-and-offset-faces.md)

5. Move you mouse cursor inward, and press the **Tab key** and type in **4"**

6. **Single click** the top face to select it, then click again to start the **drag face** operation. Push the face all the way down, until it disappears

#### Import a Material from the Autodesk Material Library

5. **Right-click** on the Blue Reflective material you just imported and choose **Paint with Material**. **Double-click the Glass Walls group** to apply the material.

**Note**: *Much like undo/redo, materials are applied and edited on a per group basis.*

1. **Copy the Floor 1 Group** to create the roof by holding the **Ctrl key** down while **dragging** the group.

2. Make the copied Group unique, edit it and name it **Roof**. Import and paint the Roof with the material **Concrete &gt; White**.

3. Create the lower terrace by following the plan and using the Rectangle tool ( R ) **55' 3" long and 22'-7 3/4" wide** and extruding it **1'**. Group this and name it **Lower Terrace**.

4. Move it **2'-2"** off the ground.

5. Import and paint the Floor 1 and Lower Terrace with the material **Stone &gt; Travertine**.

6. Edit the Travertine material in both groups. Click the **Color value** and change it to **190** to lighten the effect of the material.
