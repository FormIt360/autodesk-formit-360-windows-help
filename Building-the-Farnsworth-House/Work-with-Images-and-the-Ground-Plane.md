### Work with Images and the Ground Plane

You may import PNG images onto the ground plane by using the File &gt; Import menu. However, to gain more control over the scale and position, we will place a material texture onto a plane that we will draw ourselves. The **plan.png** image is 3600 pixels wide by 2400 pixels high. By measuring the scale on the plan, we see that 1' is 25 pixels. This will allow us to scale the image properly in the scene


1. Click the Top View icon from the Navigation Bar to see the scene from above

    ![](./images/TopView.png)    

2. Choose the [**Rectangle tool (R)**](../tool-library/rectangle-tool.md) from the 3D Sketch toolbar and draw a rectangle **144'** by **96'**

3. While the dimension is visible, click the **Tab key** to access a dialog where you can input exact dimensions. Click **OK** to commit the dimension. Click **Esc** to clear the Rectangle tool

2. Open the [**Material Palette**](../formit-introduction/tool-bars.md) and click the **+** icon to create a new material

3. Name the new material **Floor Plan**

4. Find the Texture preview tile and click the **folder icon**, browse to **plan.png** in the **FormIt Primer release\Part 1 datasets\drawings** folder, click OK

4. Change the scale of the image. Enter **144'** in the Horizontal field and **96'** in the Vertical field, click OK to finish the material

5. In the [**Material Palette**](../formit-introduction/tool-bars.md) **single click** on the **Floor Plan material tile** to paint with this material
6. Click on the **rectangle** you sketched

6. **Double-click** the **entire plane** to select it. **Right click** and choose [**Rotate (Q)**](../tool-library/placing-and-modifying-objects/rotate.md). Move the Rotate widget to the bottom left corner and rotate the image **9 degrees counter clockwise**.

7. **Right click** on the **ground plane** and choose [**Set Axes (SZ)**](../tool-library/world-axes.md). Move the axis to the bottom left corner of the of the image plane. Move the axis so that it is alinged to the angle of the plane. The ground plan grid is now aligned to the image â€“ which will make 3D sketching much easier.
