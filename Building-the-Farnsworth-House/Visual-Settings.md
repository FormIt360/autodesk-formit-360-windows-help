### Visual Settings
Moving your conceptual model to Revit for documentation is only half of the deliverables that come from FormIt. The other half are beautiful graphics that help to tell a story to a client, or team member. We'll cover ways to set up your **camera scenes**, your **graphic visual styles**, and **export your images** at high resolution.

If you did not complete the last section, download and open the **farnsworth10.axm** file from the [FormIt Primer folder](https://autodesk.app.box.com/s/thavswirrbflit27rbqzl26ljj7fu1uv/1/9025446442).

#### Scenes

1. Open the **Scenes** palette

    ![](./images/ScenesIcon.png)

2. **Double click** the only saved Scene - the camera animates to take you to that stored viewpoint 

3. The visual styles, shadow settings, and layer states update to what was stored when that scene was set up

2. In the [**Scenes Palette**](../formit-introduction/tool-bars.md) and click the **"+"** icon twice to add two more scenes

3. Rename the new scenes (in the Scene properties, lower in the palette) **Southwest ground** and **Aerial**

4. Navigate the camera to an aerial view. Turn on the **trees** layer and turn off the **plan image** layer

5. **Single click** on the **Aerial** scene once and then click the **update** icon. This will set the scene to current camera viewpoint.

6. The Scene properties checkboxes determine whether or not changes to those settings will affect the scene.

3. The check boxes determine the visibility of the items. The sliders allow you to affect the weight of normal edges and silhouette edges.

4. Turn **Monotone Surfaces** on. This strips all colors from the scene. See image below.
