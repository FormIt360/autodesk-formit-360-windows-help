### Adding Detail
FormIt is a great massing tool - and it is **also** a great modeling tool. We'll start to add a bit more detail to the Farnsworth house in the form of doors and mullions for the glass box. We'll cover some additional tools, and practice the process of adding new geometry, layers, materials, and group management.

If you did not complete the last section, download and open the **farnsworth04.axm** file from the [FormIt Primer folder](https://autodesk.app.box.com/s/thavswirrbflit27rbqzl26ljj7fu1uv/1/9025446442).

#### Door Frames
We are going to create a 2" metal frame and mullions around the window glass. These mullions will overlap with the glass box, and that is intentional. 

1. **Turn off** the **Roof** layer so we can see the entire glass box. Turn on the **North Arrow** with the **DN** keyboard shortcut

2. Use the [**Rectangle tool (R)**](../tool-library/rectangle-tool.md) to draw a surface over the western face of glass. Since the glass box is a group, then this new rectangle will not "stick" to the glass box!

3. Use the [**Offset Face tool (OF)**](../tool-library/extrude-cut-and-offset-faces.md) and the **Tab key** to offset another rectangle **2"** towards the interior.

4. **Select** and **extrude** the frame 2" towards the interior.

5. Group and name the assembly **EW Frame**.

6. Import and paint the column with the material **Metal &gt; Anodized – Gray**.

7. [**Copy** or **Array**](../tool-library/tilt-array-copy-and-paste.md) the assembly to the eastern side of the building.

8. Repeat steps 1-6 for the North and South sides as well.

#### Create Mullions

1. Using the same methods in the previous exercise, create a 2" thick and deep mullion **11'-10 ¾"** from the North West corner.

2. Make the mullion the entire height of the glass walls (11'10").

3. Group and name the assembly **mullion**.

4. Import and paint the column with the material **Metal &gt; Anodized – Gray**.

5. [**Array**](../tool-library/tilt-array-copy-and-paste.md) them three times at a distance of **11'**.

6. Use the **hover + Tab key** to select all mullion instances and **copy** to the south side of the wall.

#### Create Door
Using the same methods as in the previous two exercises, create a 3'-6" double door centered in the western wall.
