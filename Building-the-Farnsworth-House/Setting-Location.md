### Setting Location

Setting your projectâ€™s location in the world is important for the accuracy of down-stream analyses. It also allows you to import a scaled satellite image to use as a background reference. This is an ideal first step on almost every FormIt project.


#### Set Location:

1. Click the Location Icon from the toolbar

    - Satellite image is imported to scale with True North facing up.
    - Go to the [**Visual Styles Palette**](../tool-library/tool-bars-extended.md) and enable **North Arrow** to see an interactive indicator of true north.
    - Once back in the 3D scene, **select the satellite image** by doubleclicking. Open the [**Properties Palette**](../tool-library/tool-bars-extended.md) and lower the transparency slider about **1/3**. ![](./images/038168bf-b019-4a1f-8fb7-308ae4fe218e1.png)
