### Solar and Energy Analysis
Now that the model has been created we can utilize it to study the **solar and energy impact** of our design. These features are built into FormIt so your earliest studies can be understood from a building performance perspective. These features are **FormIt Pro** only, if you are following along on the web app, you may not have access.

If you did not complete the last section, click the File &gt; Open and choose **farnsworth09.axm** from the FormIt Primer folder.

#### Shadows
Before any of these analysis tools can be used, you need to [set the location](/Building-the-Farnsworth-House/Setting-Location.md). This gives FormIt access to accurate sun, shadows and climate data

1. Click on the Sun Icon in the [**Action Tool Bar**](../formit-introduction/tool-bars.md) and check **Display Shadows**.

2. Move the Day and Hour sliders to see the shadow effects. Note in this house how the covered terrace is shaded during the hottest hours of the summer months – surely not an accident but a matter of design!

#### Solar Analysis
1. From the same [**Sun menu**](../formit-introduction/tool-bars.md), click **Solar Analysis**.

2. Click on the surfaces you want to study and click **Analyze**.

3. The Month Peak setting displays the peak solar insolation in BTU/sq. ft for that month. Hover your cursor over an analyzed surface to get a specific value.

4. The Year Cumulative setting displays the cumulative energy for the entire year in KwH/sq. meter. This is useful for gaining an early idea of solar PV potential for surfaces of your design.

### Energy Analysis with Insight 360
1. Hide all of the layers except for Massing.

2. Click the **Insight 360 &gt; Generate Insight button.** Any visible masses with levels applied will be sent to Insight 360 for Analysis.
