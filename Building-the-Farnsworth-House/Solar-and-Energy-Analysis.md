### Solar and Energy Analysis
If you did not complete the last section, click the File &gt; Open and choose **farnsworth07.axm** from the FormIt Primer folder.

#### Shadows
Setting the location allows you to accurately analyze how sun shadows ill fall and affect your design – allowing you to make better decisions.

1. Click on the Sun Icon in the [**Action Tool Bar**](../formit-introduction/tool-bars.md) and check **Display Shadows**.

2. Move the Day and Hour sliders to see the shadow effects. Note in this house how the covered terrace is shaded during the hottest hours of the summer months – surely not an accident but a matter of design!

#### Solar Analysis
1. From the same [**Sun menu**](../formit-introduction/tool-bars.md), click **Solar Analysis**.

2. Click on the surfaces you want to study and click **Analyze**.

3. The Month Peak setting displays the peak solar insolation in BTU/sq. ft for that month. Hover your cursor over an analyzed surface to get a specific value.

4. The Year Cumulative setting displays the cumulative energy for the entire year in KwH/sq. meter. This is useful for gaining an early idea of solar PV potential for surfaces of your design.
