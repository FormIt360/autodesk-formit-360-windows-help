# Meshes

Starting in v17.0, FormIt offers a new type of geometry: a Mesh. 

Meshes are lightweight representations of standard FormIt objects, and are great for improving the performance of high-polygon geometry like furniture and 3D entourage like people, trees, cars, and signage. Meshes are also great for complex DWG geometry that might otherwise affect FormIt's performance. 

Any edge, face, or solid body can be converted to a mesh:

* Simply select an object, and either use shortcut OM \(Objects to Meshes\) or right-click and select Objects to Meshes in the Context Menu:
