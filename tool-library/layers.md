# Layers

Use Layers to control visibility of FormIt objects. You can see Layers in action by following the [FormIt Primer.](https://windows.help.formit.autodesk.com/building-the-farnsworth-house/control-visibility-with-layers)

## Create Layers

In the Layers panel, you can create and name your Layers by clicking the "**+**" icon. You can double-click the name to rename the Layer, or toggle the visibility of its objects by checking and unchecking the box.

## Managing Objects on Layers

Select objects in the canvas, then use the drop-down at the top of the Layers panel to indicate which Layer the selected objects should be placed on. 

You can right-click a Layer and choose "Select All Objects On Layer" to select all the geometry currently assigned to this Layer.

You can also reorder the Layers in the panel, but this has no impact on geometry visibility - this is purely an organizational tool in the panel.
