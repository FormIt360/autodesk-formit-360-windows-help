# Copy Object

There are three ways to copy an object. First select the object by **double-clicking** on it:

1. Right click the cube. Select the [**Copy tool**](tilt-array-copy-and-paste.md) in the Context Menu and then right click anywhere else in the scene and choose the **Paste button**. \(This also works with **CTRL + C** or **V**\). Use Paste In Place \(CTRL+Shift+V\) to paste an object exactly where it was copied from.
2. Hold the **CTRL key down** and start dragging the object - a copy will be available to drag.
3. **Right click** the cube and select the [**Array tool**](tilt-array-copy-and-paste.md). You can select the number of copies and whether the next drag will define the distance between two objects or the total length of the array.   ![](../.gitbook/assets/c587fa65-069f-4d8c-910e-f19c8cf36aff.png)
