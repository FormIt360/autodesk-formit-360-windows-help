**Copy Using the Context Menu**

2. Right-click the object 
3. Select the [**Copy tool**](tilt-array-copy-and-paste.md) in the Context Menu
4. Right-click anywhere else in the scene and choose the **Paste button**.

**Copy Using the Array Tool**

1. Select the object by double-clicking it
2. **Right click** the object and select the [**Array tool**](tilt-array-copy-and-paste.md)
3. Select the number of copies you want to make
4. Choose whether the next drag will define the distance between two objects or the total length of the array
5. Click **OK**   ![](../.gitbook/assets/c587fa65-069f-4d8c-910e-f19c8cf36aff.png)
