# Content Library

Content Libraries are a convenient way to store components and other items you want to use repeatedly. By default, FormIt includes several Libraries of samples, including a Library of furniture samples, and a Library of Dynamo sample scripts. In FormIt 2021, BIM 360 content can now be accessed and consumed from the Content Library.
