### Levels and Area

Once you've created geometry in FormIt you can start to take advantage of BIM related workflows unique to FormIt's solid modeling tools.

Levels in FormIt are like Levels in Revit - datums that correspond to Floor heights. Once Levels have been created, they need to be applied to geometry, then you can calculate Area.

When Levels are applied to geometry they will import to Revit - you can then create Mass floors, floor by face, and floor plans associated with the FormIt levels.
