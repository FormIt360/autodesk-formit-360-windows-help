# Levels and Area

Once you've created geometry in FormIt you can start to take advantage of BIM-related workflows unique to FormIt's solid modeling tools.

Levels in FormIt are like Levels in Revit: data that corresponds to floor heights. After you create Levels, You can apply them to geometry to calculate area.

When Levels are applied to geometry, the levels will import to Revit. In Revit, you can use the FormIt levels to create Mass floors, Floor by Face, and floor plans associated with the FormIt levels.

[See this page from the FormIt Primer for more](../building-the-farnsworth-house/adding-floors-with-levels.md) information about levels.
