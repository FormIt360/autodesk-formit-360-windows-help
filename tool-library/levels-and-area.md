### Levels and Area
Once you've created geometry in FormIt you can start to take advantage of a few BIM related workflows unique to FormIt's solid modeling tools.

Once Levels have been created, they need to be applied to the geometry you want to calculate area. When Levels are applied to geometry, these Levels import to Revit for consistency without re-work!
