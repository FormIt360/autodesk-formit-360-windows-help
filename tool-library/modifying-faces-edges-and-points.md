# Modifying Faces, Edges, and Points

Things get really interesting when you start to push and pull the objects you have placed. Single click will allow you to select a single vertex, edge, face, or Mesh.

## Modifying Faces

1. Single-click a face
2. FormIt automatically puts you in the Drag Face or Extrude tool. 
3. Click somewhere to identify a starting point for the operation. 
4. After you click, you can snap to other objects to align this face to.
5. As with move, you can click the **temporary dimension** or simply start typing a value to define the amount of move.
