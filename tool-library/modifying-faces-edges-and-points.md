# Modifying Faces, Edges, and Points

Things get really interesting when you start to push and pull the objects you have placed. Single click will allow you to select a single face, edge or, different than older version of FormIt, a corner or point.

## Modifying Faces

1. [**Single click one**](select-edge-face-or-object.md) of the faces of the objects.
2. You can immediately drag that face to **push** or **pull** it. There is no need to invoke a separate tool. You can use the **snapping** to snap this face aligned with other objects in the scene.
3. As with move, you can click the **temporary dimension** or use **Tab key** to define the amount of move. ![](../.gitbook/assets/b61b2045-21a9-434b-b806-6cfa16e94fdd.png)
4. You can also delete a face by using **Delete key**: **Right click &gt; X button**.

## Modifying Edges

1. Single click one of the edges of one of the cubes.
2. You can now drag the edge along one of the axes to redefine the shape. ![](../.gitbook/assets/934b206f-0d73-4530-b89f-e9b0181e2a55.png)
3. You can also delete an edge by:
   * Pressing **Delete key**
   * **Right click &gt; X button**

## Modifying Points

1. [Single click](select-edge-face-or-object.md) one of the corners of one of the cubes.
2. Similar to an edge, you drag the point along one of the axes to redefine the shape. ![](../.gitbook/assets/439874f1-e07d-4d45-9574-f52ce2761536.png)
