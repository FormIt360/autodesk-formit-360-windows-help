# Measure Angle

The measure angle tool is located on the [Tool Bar](../formit-introduction/tool-bars.md).

The measure angel tool is used to measure angles between vertices, edges, faces, and volumes. You can also use the measure to drive drive dimensions of geometry.

* Select measure tool from the Action Tool Bar or short key **M A** and and select starting point.
