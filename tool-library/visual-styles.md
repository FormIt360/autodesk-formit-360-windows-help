# Visual Styles

Going beyond the default look and feel of FormIt graphics is easy and all of the settings are located in one place. The important thing to remember about visual styles is that they are scene specific so you can set up different moods for different perspectives all in the same model

## Surfaces

Lighten or darken all materials using the **Ambient Brightness** control.

Control how much lighting from the sun affects materials with **Ambient Contrast**. A value of 0 means that lighting has no effect, whereas 100 will lighting effects more pronounced.

Toggle on shadows from sun direction; you can use the **Shadow Intensity** slider to determine how visible shadows will be. **Ambient shadows** and **Monotone** mode - which turns the entire scene black and white - can also be toggled on and off.

Manage the default colors of faces, lines and the poch√© effect when the[ Section Plane](section-planes.md) tool is used
