# Move Object

1. **Double Click** to select an entire object \(single-click to select a face, edge or vertex, which is explained in [Modifying Faces Edges and Points](modifying-faces-edges-and-points.md).\)
2. **Right click** on the cube and select the **Move Group** tool from the **Context Menu**. ![](../.gitbook/assets/context-menu.png)
3. Click and move the circle to the point you will use as the **snap point.** ![](../.gitbook/assets/snap-point.png)
4. **Click and then start dragging**. You are now moving the object and the preselected point will now be your snap point.   ![](../.gitbook/assets/move-object.png)
5. Press the **tab key.** You can now type in a specific distance to move that object along the current axis.
