### Working with External Data

Add overlays and images to your designs for a variety of purposes. Ground overlays add additional information to your sketch or provide a schematic to trace over. 

Download files and content from SketchUp 3D Warehouse and bring them directly into FormIt with full editing capabilities. Also directly import Google Earth topographical files from SketchUp.
