- Groups in FormIt can be categorized to become Revit Families like: Generic, Furniture, Specialty Equipment, etc

- Revit Families can be exported as FormIt Groups, and then in the future, automatically converted back to the original Revit Family

#### Iteration between FormIt and Revit projects

- The Import FormIt command allows you to place FormIt objects into the Revit template of your choice

- The Import FormIt to Revit command adds FormIt objects into an existing Revit project for easy update as the design evolves

- The Group Name in FormIt is remembered upon Revit Import allowing Filters

#### Iteration between Revit and FormIt 360
