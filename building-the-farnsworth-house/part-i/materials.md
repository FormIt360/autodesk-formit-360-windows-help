# Paint with Materials

As we saw in an [**earlier exercise**](work-with-images-and-the-ground-plane.md), you can create your own materials, and then paint those materials to faces in FormIt. In this exercise you will create and edit your own materials and import materials from the Autodesk Material library

## Create the Glass Walls

1. Use the [**Rectangle-Tool-\(R\)**](../../tool-library/rectangle-tool.md) to create another surface on top of the existing floor group. Make sure you are not editing the Floor group, but drawing on top of the grouped object.

2. Click to start the rectangle sketch at the back corner of the existing floor. Draw the rectangle at these dimensions: **28'-8" x 55'-5 Â½".**
3. Click **Esc** to exit the rectangle tool. **Single-click** inside the new rectangle to select the face.

4. Click once to start the **Drag face** operation. Move your mouse upwards along the Z-axis, and click the **Tab key** to set the height to **11'-2".**
5. **Double-click** and **Group \(G\)** the new geometry.
6. **Double-click** the group to edit it. In the **Properties Palette** name the group **Glass Walls.**
7. Right-click on the top face and choose the [**Offset Face tool \(OF\)**](../../tool-library/extrude-cut-and-offset-faces.md)**.**
8. Move your mouse cursor inward, press the **Tab key,** and type in **4".**

9. Click **Esc** twice to clear the tool, and the selection.
10. **Single-click** the interior top face to select it, then click again to start the **drag face** operation. Push the face all the way down, until it disappears.

11. End Edit Group mode by double-clicking off in space or hitting **Esc**
12. Select the **Glass Walls** group with a **single click** and put it on the **Floor 1** layer.

## Import a Material from the Autodesk Material Library

1. Edit the **Glass Walls** group by double-clicking into it.
2. Select the [**Materials Palette**](../../formit-introduction/tool-bars.md)**.**
3. Click the **Import Materials button.**

4. In the Materials Library dialog, choose **Glazing** from the categories on the left. Next, choose **Blue Reflective**, and click **OK.**

5. In the Materials palette, **Single-click** the preview tile for the Blue Reflective material you just imported. This launches the Paintbrush tool with the Blue Reflective material active.
6. **Double-click** the **Glass Walls** geometry to apply the material to the entire object.

7. Click **Esc** to exit the **Paintbrush** tool, then **ESC** again, or **double click** off in space to exit the group.

## Quick Copy the Floor to Create the Roof

1. Select the **Floor** group with a **single click.**
2. Click one of the lower corners to start the **Move** tool.
3. Start moving the Floor up along the blue axis. Create a **quick copy** by tapping the **Ctrl key**. A "ghost" preview of the copy should appear.

4. While moving along the blue axis, start typing **12' 2"** and a dimension box will appear. Click **OK** or press Enter to finalize the position.

## Edit the Roof

1. While the copied group is still selected, use the **Make Unique \(MU\)** command.
2. **Double-click** the group to edit it. Re-name the group **Roof** in the **Properties Palette**. Exit the group by **double-clicking** off in space.
3. Make a new **Layer** called **Roof** and add it to the **Roof** group. You can toggle the layer on and off to verify the correct elements are on the roof.
4. Import the **Concrete &gt; White** material. **Single-click** the material tile so you can paint with it.

5. Single-click the **Roof group** to paint it with the material. The entire group is now painted.

_**Note:** This is a helpful technique that allows you to paint different instances of the same group with different materials_

## Create the Lower Terrace

1. Find the **lower terrace** on the floor plan and zoom into that area.
2. You may need to toggle **Snap to Grid \(SG\)** on or off to click the corner of the image.
3. Draw a **Rectangle \(R\)** **55' 3" long and 22'-7 3/4" wide**, then extrude it by **1'.**
4. **Double-click** to select the geometry, then **Group \(G\)** it.
5. **Double-click** to edit the group and name it **Lower Terrace**. **Double-click** off in space to exit the group.

   ![](../../.gitbook/assets/upperterracesketch_10.png)

6. **Double-click** to edit the group and name it **Lower Terrace**
7. **Single-click** to select the Lower Terrace group. Click one of the corners and **Move** it up **2'-2"** off the ground plane.
8. Import the material **Stone &gt; Travertine.**
9. In the **Materials Palette**, find the **Travertine** material and **Double click** the preview tile.
10. This launches the **Material Editor**. Click the **Color** preview. Change the **Value** to **190** to lighten the **tint** of the material.

    ![](../../.gitbook/assets/7d23f82c-2f5f-4e09-b3bf-24841cccbd0a.png)

11. **Paint** the **Floor 1** and **Lower Terrace** groups with the **Travertine** material.
