# Navigating the Scene

Use your mouse or touchscreen to easily navigate in and around your FormIt models:

* **Orbit** by right-clicking and dragging the mouse. This will use a point in 3D space about which to orbit the camera.
  * You can also hold Shift to Pan.
* **Zoom** in and out by scrolling the mouse wheel up and down. This will use a point in 3D space at which to zoom to, and will slow down the zoom as you approach a surface or another object.
  * You can also hold Ctrl to zoom at a constant rate, not affected by proximity to objects.
* **Pan** by middle-clicking a point on the screen and dragging the mouse.

You can also use the floating navigation toolbar to go into specific view presets or modes. Shortcuts noted in parentheses.
