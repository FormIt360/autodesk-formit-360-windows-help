### Recommended Windows DPI Settings

FormIt for Windows works best when the screen it's displayed on is set to 125% or less DPI scaling in Windows. 

You can change this in Windows 10 by doing the following:
- Search "Display" in the Start Menu, and choose "Change Display Settings." 
- Select the rectangle representing the monitor you'll be using FormIt on
- Under "Scale and Layout" section, change the "size of text, apps, and other items" dropdown to 125% or less.
