# Setting Up the Project

## Setting Up the Project

When you start FormIt, you'll be in an empty 3D environment. You can start drawing new geometry, 

FormIt allows opening, saving, and exporting to files both locally and on BIM 360 Docs. [Using BIM 360 Docs in FormIt](https://formit.autodesk.com/page/formit-bim-360-docs) is a great way to share models in the cloud.

## Saving Your Work
