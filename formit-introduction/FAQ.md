%accordion% What is the difference between Formit, FormIt 360, and FormIt Pro? %accordion%  
The "360" in FormIt has been retired.  "FormIt" refers to the entire product. The free versions are on Web and iOS. FormIt PRO refers to a subscription available only if you purchase the Autodesk AEC Industry Collection. The subscription enables some additional features on iOS and Web and also enables you to run the Windows client.

%accordion% What about Android? %accordion%  
In an effort to streamline the FormIt product offering, we had to make the hard decision to discontinue the Android app. If you have it installed, it will continue to run. However, you will no longer be able to install it from the Play Store as of January 30, 2018. Any files you saved to Autodesk 360 Drive from the Android app are still available. You can access them using any of the current apps, including the free Web version.
