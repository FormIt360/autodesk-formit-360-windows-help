%accordion% What happened to the Android version?%accordion% 

In an effort to streamline the FormIt product offering, we had to make the hard decision to discontinue the Android app.   
If you have it installed, it will continue to run. However, you will no longer be able to install it from the Play Store as of January 30, 2018.   
Any files you saved to Autodesk 360 Drive from the Android app are still available. You can access them using any of the current apps, including the free Web version.Â
