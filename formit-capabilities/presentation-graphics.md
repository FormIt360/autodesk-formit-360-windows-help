# Presentation Graphics

There is a suite of visual style settings that can be applied to quickly visualize and study your FormIt model. 

FormIt allows you to control how elements are viewed within the sketch by adjusting shadows, surfaces, edges, and the environment. In addition to a pre-populated list of materials, you can make your own materials out of images and color that can be quickly applied to bring your model to life. Layers can be used to control the visibility of lines, objects, groups, or images.
