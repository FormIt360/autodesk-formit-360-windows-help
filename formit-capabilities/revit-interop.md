# Revit Interoperability

Use FormIt and Revit together to move seamlessly between Schematic Design and Design Documentation phases.

## Conceptual Massing in FormIt

* FormIt objects become Revit Mass Families with materials applied. This supports the Wall by Face, Curtain System by Face, and Roof by Face workflows for creating detailed elements
* FormIt Levels become Revit Levels and support Mass Floors, Floor by Face, and Floor Plan view creation

## Conceptual Modeling with Revit content in FormIt

* Groups in FormIt can be categorized to become Revit Families, such as Generic, Furniture, Specialty Equipment, and more
* Revit Families can be exported as FormIt Groups and automatically converted back to the original Revit Family later

## Iteration between FormIt and Revit projects

* The FormIt Converter add-in allows you to place FormIt objects into the Revit template of your choice for easy updating as the design evolves
* The FormIt origin point uses the Revit base point for reliable placement of imported FormIt objects
* Revit geometry can be exported to FormIt using SAT export options
* Revit Families can be exported as FormIt Groups, and then in the future, automatically converted back to the original Revit Family
